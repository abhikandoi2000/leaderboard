Leaderboard
===========

Leaderboard is a social application that keeps track of a user's score across
various websites. All data is easily viewed in a tabular format for all users
across the app. Leaderboard updates itself with the latest data as well.

#Websites
The basic version will include the following

- Github (follower count)
- Last.FM (listen count)
- Stackoverflow (reputation)
- AskUbuntu (reputation)
- Facebook (subscribers)
- Dropbox (total space)
- Twitter (follower count)

More services are planned. Services that require authentication ask for a minimal
authentication via oauth.

#Authentication
The authentication mechanism for a user is based on Github's organization
